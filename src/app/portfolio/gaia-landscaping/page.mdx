## Overview

This project is all about clean, practical design that looks good and works well. Every detail was carefully considered to make sure the website is easy to use and navigate. It focuses on a simple, straightforward layout that lets users find what they need without any distractions.

The design is modern, but not over the top—just a solid balance between style and functionality that gets the job done while still looking great.
